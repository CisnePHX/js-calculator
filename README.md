# js-calculator
Calculator creation project as a part of the Odin Project: this is a simple calculator with only the ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide. It can remember previous totals until the "clear" button is pressed, but otherwise doesn't support any algebraic functionality. It was created entirely with CSS Flex design and Javascript functionality.

Please let me know if you find any errors with this application!
